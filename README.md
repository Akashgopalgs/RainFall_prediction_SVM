# Rain Prediction in Australia

### Overview

This project aims to predict rainfall using historical weather data. It uses machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree Classifier, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) to build a predictive model. The final model is deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to input weather parameters and receive predictions on whether it will rain the next day.

### Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, outliers, and encodes categorical variables.
- **Model Training:** Utilizes pipelines for training machine learning models.
- **Interactive Prediction:** Deploys a user-friendly web application using Streamlit.
- **Model Evaluation:** Provides accuracy and classification reports for model evaluation.
### Model
The model is trained using several machine learning algorithms. The final model used for prediction is a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) with an accuracy of 79.49%.

#### Results
The SVC model achieved the following results:

- Accuracy: 85.53%
